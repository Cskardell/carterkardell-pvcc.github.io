<h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
</style> 
<h2>Phases of Computer Program Development</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem.</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem.</li>
    <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in an appropriate language based on the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save.</li>
    <li>Phase 5: Execute the program.</li>
    <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest.</li>
    <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Programming Structures</h2>
<p>Programming structures include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
    <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
    <li>Iterative (Looping):
        <ul>
            <li>while loop: continue looping as long something is true</li>
            <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
            <li>for loop: loop a given number of times.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Recursive structures: Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself.
        <p>Repetition continues until a degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base case").</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Two Classic Programming/Database Problems</h2>
<p>Two classic programming/database problems include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sorting:
        <ul>
            <li>Descending order/Ascending order.</li>
            <li>Sorting numbers</li>
            <li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Searching:
        <p>In a database, searching can involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Two popular search techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time.</li>
            <li>Binary search: only works if data is SORTED first. Start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Two Classic Program Goals</h2>
<p>Two classic program goals are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources.</li>
    <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Software Testing and Verification</h2>
<p>Software testing is a critical aspect of software development. It involves various kinds of tests to ensure software quality:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</li>
    <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li>
    <li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</li>
    <li>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a <br> common way to verify functions.</li>
    <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate <br>performance under real-life load conditions.</li>
    <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus,<br> functions, and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</li>
    <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li>
    <li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software testing is done to prevent:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Architectural flaws</li>
    <li>Poor design decisions</li>
    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
    <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Scalability issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing best practices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Continuous Testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available, relying on test automation integrated with the deployment process.</li>
    <li>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test.</li>
    <li>Service Visualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development.</li>
    <li>Defect or Bug Tracking: Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality.</li>
    <li>Metrics and Reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals, and test results.</li>
</ul>
