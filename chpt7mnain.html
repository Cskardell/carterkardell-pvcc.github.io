  <tr>
    <td>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Purpose of IEEE:</strong> To foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. Focuses on the hardware engineering aspect of computers.<br>
      <strong>Benefits of IEEE Membership:</strong> Access to innovation and cutting-edge technology and networking opportunities.<br>
      <strong>Student IEEE Membership:</strong> Like normal benefits but focused on students and school settings.

  <!-- Software Life Cycle: Development Phase -->
  <tr>
    <td>Software Life Cycle: Development Phase</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Requirement Analysis:</strong> Specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system.<br>
      <strong>Design:</strong> Design involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system.<br>
      <strong>Implementation:</strong> Implementation involves the actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases.<br>
      <strong>Testing:</strong> The traditional development phase of the past, testing was essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirements specification.<br>

  <!-- Modular Implementation -->
  <tr>
    <td>Modular Implementation</td>
    <td>Emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules.</td>

  <!-- Unified Modeling Language (UML) -->
  <tr>
    <td>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</td>
    <td>Provides standard notation for many types of diagrams which can be roughly divided into three main groups: behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.</td>
  </tr>

  <!-- Use Case and Use Case Diagram -->
  <tr>
    <td>Use Case</td>
    <td>A written description of how users will perform tasks on your website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use Case Diagram</td>
    <td>Depicts the proposed system as a large rectangle in which interactions (called use cases) between the system and its users are represented as ovals and users of the system (called actors) are represented as stick figures (even though an actor may not be a person).</td>

  <!-- Data Relationships -->
  <tr>
    <td>Data Relationships</td>
    <td>
      <strong>One-to-one:</strong> A link between the information in two tables, where each record in each table only appears once.<br>
      <strong>One-to-many:</strong> One record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table.<br>
      <strong>Many-to-many:</strong> When multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table.

    <td>Groups which are charged with overseeing and enforcing the quality control systems adopted by the organization.</td>
  </tr>

  <!-- Software Testing -->
  <tr>
    <td>Software Testing</td>
    <td>
      <strong>Glass box testing:</strong> The software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test.<br>
      <strong>Black box testing:</strong> Tests that do not rely on knowledge of the software’s interior composition.<br>
      <strong>Beta testing:</strong> A preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software performs in real-life situations before the final version of the product is solidified and released to the market.<br>
      <strong>Alpha testing:</strong> Real-world testing done at a developer’s site.

    <td>Documentation</td>
    <td>
      <strong>User documentation:</strong> Explains features of the software and describe how to use them.<br>
      <strong>System Documentation:</strong> Describes the software’s internal composition so that the software can be maintained later in its life cycle.<br>
      <strong>Technical Documentation:</strong> Describes how a software system should be installed and serviced (such as adjusting operating parameters, installing updates, and reporting problems back to the software’s developer).
