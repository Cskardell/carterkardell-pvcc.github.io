<!--QUESTION 1 --> 
    <h5> Q: What is a version control system?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: A version control system is a practice that manages the changes to source code over time.</h6></ul>
<!-- Question 2-->      
    <h5> Q: What is a git?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: A git is a version control system itself that manages the changes to code over time. 
        It gives us the ability to answer "who?""what?"and "why?" questions when looking at code changes.</h6></ul>
<!--QUESTION 3-->
    <h5> Q: What is GitHub?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: GitHub is a platform that utilizes Git in a cloud based format. Which, makes it much easier for large groups to collaborate on projects.</h6></ul>
<!-- QUESTION 4-->
    <h5> Q: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: Git is the software that actually tracks the code changes. GitHub utilizes that software in a cloud based, UI friendly, platform. wh</h6></ul>
<!-- QUESTION 5 -->
    <h5> Q: Who started GitHub and how?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and P.J Hyett were writing code for a computer review site. These three predominately used a software 
        called "Ruby on Rails" for their work. This software had a open source model where "trusted programmers" could add and commit changes to the original
        Ruby on Rails code to improve it. If another coder wished to impliment their own ideas into Ruby on Rails, they had to petition a trusted coder. That
        process was not easy, so Tom, Chris, and P.J saw this flaw and began using the relatively unknown Git system to build a platform where coders could easily collaborate. After it's official launch, GitHub took off
        and recieved increased venture capital funding. Now it is used by more than 14 million people.
    </h6></ul>
<!-- QUESTION 6-->
    <h5> Q: What company owns it now? </h5>
    <ul><h6> A: Microsoft used GitHub so extensively in their own software development, they eventually bought the company.</h6></ul>
<!-- QUESTION 7-->
    <h5> Q: How much does a GitHub account cost?</h5>
    <ul><h6> A: A GitHub account is free! However, there are premium packages and features blocked with pay-walls.</h6></ul>
<!-- QUESTION 8-->
    <h5> Q: What is the "Octocat"?</h5>
    <ul><h6> The Octocat is the GitHub mascot. It depicts a cat like form with octopus tentacles. It was chosen by the GitHub team 
        supposedly to represent the complex nature of coding.
